# Whatsapp chat sentiment analyzer

If you're seeking a tool that goes beyond identifying the most positive user in your then, This WhatsApp Chat Sentiment Analyzer provides insights not only on individual positivity but also on the overall sentiment of the group.

During its development, I conducted extensive experiments on WhatsApp data, exploring a range of Machine Learning Algorithms including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN. Additionally, I explored various NLP encoding techniques such as Tokenization, TF-IDF, and Bag of Words. To enhance usability, I visualized communication patterns using Streamlit.
